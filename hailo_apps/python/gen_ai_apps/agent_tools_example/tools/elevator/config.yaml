  YOUR TASK: Interpret the user's request and call this tool with the integer floor number or relative movement.
  Match room names, or location descriptions to the correct floor.
  Use the floor directory above to find the correct floor number.

  Match user requests to floors using:
  - Floor names (exact or partial matches)
  - Floor and room descriptions (match user's description to floor descriptions above)
  - Natural language descriptions (e.g., "top floor" → Floor 5, "basement" → Floor 0)
  - IMPORTANT: "First floor" is Floor 1 (Chocolate Room), NOT Floor 0.

  RELATIVE MOVEMENTS: When the user requests to move up or down a certain number of floors, use the 'relative_floor' parameter:
  - "two floors up" → relative_floor: 2
  - "move down 1 floor" → relative_floor: -1
  - "go up one floor" → relative_floor: 1
  - "move down 3 floors" → relative_floor: -3
  - Positive integers = move up, negative integers = move down

  DEFAULT OPTION: If the user requests a floor number outside the available range (0-5), or if you cannot determine which floor the user wants, set 'default' to true.
