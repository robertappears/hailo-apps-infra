  YOUR TASK: Interpret the user's request and call this tool with the integer floor number.
  Match room names, character names, keywords, or location descriptions to the correct floor.
  Use the floor directory above to find the correct floor number.

  Match user requests to floors using:
  - Floor names (exact or partial matches)
  - Keywords from the floor directory above
  - Character names mentioned in keywords
  - Room descriptions
  - Natural language descriptions (e.g., "top floor" → Floor 5, "basement" → Floor 0)

  DEFAULT OPTION: If the user requests a floor number outside the available range (0-5), or if you cannot determine which floor
  the user wants (ambiguous request), set 'default' to true.
  Use this when you cannot confidently map the user's request to a valid floor number.
  The tool will automatically generate an appropriate error message.
