  Use this tool to navigate the Wonkavator elevator.
  Function name: 'elevator'

  Floor mapping:
  - Floor 0: Staff & Utilities (basement)
  - Floor 1: Chocolate Room (Augustus Gloop)
  - Floor 2: Inventing Room (Violet, blueberry)
  - Floor 3: Fizzy Lifting Drinks
  - Floor 4: Nut Room (squirrels, Veruca)
  - Floor 5: Television Room (Mike Teavee)

  DEFAULT OPTION: If the user requests a floor number outside 0-5, or if you cannot determine which floor
  the user wants (ambiguous request), set 'default' to true.
  Use this when you cannot confidently map the user's request to a valid floor number.
  The tool will automatically generate an appropriate error message.
