tool_instructions: |
  Use this tool for any LED or light control request.
  Function name: 'rgb_led'

  Parameters:
  - action: REQUIRED - 'on' or 'off'
  - color: OPTIONAL - color name (red, blue, green, etc.). ONLY include if user explicitly requests a color change.
    DO NOT include color if user only asks to change intensity - current color will be preserved.
  - intensity: OPTIONAL - brightness 0-100. If user only asks to change intensity, do NOT include color parameter.

  IMPORTANT: If user asks to change ONLY intensity/brightness, include ONLY action='on' and intensity.
  Do NOT include color - the LED will keep its current color.

  DEFAULT OPTION: If the user requests an unsupported color or operation, or if you cannot understand
  the LED control request, set 'default' to true. The tool will automatically generate an appropriate error message.
