# Piper TTS Models Directory

This directory contains Piper TTS voice models for voice-enabled applications.

## Installation

For installation instructions, see:
- [Voice Processing Module Documentation](../../hailo_apps/python/core/gen_ai_utils/voice_processing/README.md)

## Note

The `.onnx` and `.onnx.json` files are not tracked by git due to their size.
They must be downloaded locally on each system that uses voice features.
