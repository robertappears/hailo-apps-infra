# Hailo Apps - v25.12.0 Release Notes (December 2025)

## Welcome to Our Biggest Release Yet!

We’re thrilled to announce version 25.12.0 of the Hailo Applications Infrastructure - a complete transformation in how you build and deploy AI applications on Hailo hardware. This release focuses on making cutting-edge AI both accessible and practical, with a particular emphasis on **Generative AI** applications you can actually use.

## 🌟 Introducing GenAI Applications

### Voice Assistant - Your AI Companion

Talk naturally with AI using our complete voice assistant implementation. It listens, understands, and responds with natural speech - all running locally on your Hailo hardware.

**What it does:**

* Real-time speech recognition using Whisper
* Natural language understanding with LLMs
* Text-to-speech with Piper for human-like responses
* Continuous conversation with context awareness

```bash
python -m hailo_apps.python.gen_ai_apps.voice_assistant.voice_assistant
```

### Agent Tools Example - AI That Controls Hardware

This isn’t just a chatbot - it’s an AI that can interact with the physical world. Our agent framework demonstrates how to give AI control over real hardware components.

**Capabilities:**

* **Servo Control** - Position servos using natural language (“move to 90 degrees”)
* **RGB LED Control** - Change colors and intensity (“Turn LED red”)
* **Elevator Simulator** - Complex, multi-step operations (“go to floor 3”)
* **Extensible Tool System** - Easily add your own hardware integrations

The framework automatically discovers available tools and lets the AI decide when and how to use them. Add your own tools by simply implementing the interface.

### VLM Chat - AI That Sees

Combine computer vision with language understanding. Point your camera at something and ask questions about what it sees.

**Examples:**

* “What objects do you see?”
* “Read the text in this image.”
* “How many people are in the room?”
* “What color is the car?”

The camera feed is processed in real time, and the AI maintains conversational context so you can ask follow-up questions naturally.

## 🎯 CLIP Zero-Shot Classification

Classify images without training a custom model. Just describe what you're looking for in plain English.

**How it works:**

* Type descriptions like “a red apple,” “a person waving,” “a stop sign”
* CLIP compares your text to the video feed in real time
* Get confidence scores for each description
* Interactive GUI for easy experimentation

```bash
hailo-clip
```

The GUI lets you add and remove descriptions on the fly — perfect for exploring new use cases or demonstrating concepts to stakeholders.

## 🚀 Standalone Applications

Sometimes you don’t need a full pipeline — you just need something that works. Our standalone applications are self-contained and easy to integrate.

* **Optimized Performance** — Native implementations for minimal overhead

Each application includes build scripts and clear examples:

```bash
cd hailo_apps/cpp/object_detection
./build.sh
./build/object_detection
```

## 🛠️ Getting Started Examples

We know the hardest part is getting started. That’s why we’ve included simple, focused examples:

### Simple LLM Chat

Your first text conversation with an AI. No camera, no audio — just pure language interaction.

```bash
python -m hailo_apps.python.gen_ai_apps.simple_llm_chat.simple_llm_chat
```

Perfect for understanding how LLMs work and testing prompt strategies.

### Simple VLM Chat

Like LLM chat, but with vision. Show your camera something and ask about it.

### Simple Whisper Chat

The simplest speech recognition example. Speak and see your words transcribed.

Great for testing your microphone setup and understanding how speech-to-text works before building something more complex.

## 🎨 Developer Experience Improvements

### Unified Command-Line Interface

Every application now shares consistent CLI options:

```bash
--input-source    # Camera, video file, or image  
--hef-path        # Model file location  
--labels-json     # Class labels  
--disable-sync    # Performance tuning  
--show-fps        # Display performance  
--debug           # Detailed logging  
```

### Automatic Hardware Detection
